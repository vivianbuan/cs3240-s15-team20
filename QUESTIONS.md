#Requirement Questions
  + Who can grant permissions to see a private report? The reporters only? Anyone who has access? A select few who have access?
  + What fields are part of creating a report? (What does the reporter need to enter in order to create one?)
  + What information does the user need to provide in order to create an account? 
  + Are reporters a special class of users? Do they have anything that differentiates them from a user that is just consuming content in terms of permissions or requirements. 
  + Are readers a special class of users? Is any user automatically a reader or they need additional permission to be a reader?
  + Is a report editable after released to the system?
  + If so, who are able to edit the report, only the person who create the report or anyone who has access to it?
  + Can reporters change report permissions after the report has been published? Can they make a public report private? Can they make a private report public?
  + Is there a limit to how many users can be added to the group?
  + Can permissions be granted by folder? If so, how do those permissions propagate to subfolders and files in the folder?
  + How does a reporter view the folders/reports he has created? How does a reader view the folders/reports that he/she has access to? 
  + Is public report public to everyone(like can be searched from Google) or only public to users of the system?
  + Are folders specific to a reporter? If so, are they always public (any reader can see what folders a reporter has?) Or are they just viewed by the reporter?
  + Is there a limit to the format of files that can be shared? if so, what would that be.  
  + Will readers of a report be given any information on who else is reading the report? For instance, can they see how many people have seen the report? Can they see who has seen the report or has access to it? 
  + Who creates a system? Is the user who creates a system automatically an admin?
